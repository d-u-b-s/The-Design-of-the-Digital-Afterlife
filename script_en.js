The theory suggests that a fundamental psychological conflict arises from our instinct for self-preservation coupled with the awareness that death is inevitable and often unpredictable. This conflict generates terror, which is managed through a mix of escapism and cultural beliefs that counter the reality of mortality by offering more enduring forms of meaning and value. Essentially, these beliefs help counteract the sense of personal insignificance associated with death by providing significance through symbolism.

However, Camus distinguishes absurdism from nihilism by emphasizing that while both recognize life\'s inherent meaninglessness, they diverge in their responses to it. Nihilism often leads to despair or a rejection of all values, suggesting that since life has no inherent meaning, nothing matters. In contrast, Camus\' absurdism acknowledges the lack of ultimate meaning but advocates for a defiant embrace of life.

However, through his clinical observations, Freud noticed that some behaviors, especially those related to trauma and repetition compulsion, did not fit neatly into this model. People seemed compelled to revisit painful or destructive experiences, a phenomenon Freud could not fully explain within the framework of the pleasure principle.</p><p class="secondary-text">To account for this, Freud introduced the idea of the death drive, which he described as an unconscious wish to return to an inanimate state, or to the pre-life state. He theorized that this drive manifests in behaviors that are self-destructive, aggressive, or compulsively repetitive, reflecting an underlying desire to dissolve life back into the inertness from which it emerged. In this sense, the death drive operates as a counterbalance to the life drive, pushing toward entropy, stasis, and death.</p><p class="secondary-text">One of the primary critiques is the lack of empirical evidence supporting the existence of the death drive. Many psychologists and psychoanalysts argue that the concept is speculative and not grounded in observable phenomena.

Computers use binary data because it aligns with the physical characteristics of electronic devices. Computers and digital circuits operate using switches that are either on or off, corresponding to the binary states 1 and 0.

The complexity of this question is multiplied when we consider the privacy of those with whom the deceased had digital communications. The deceased’s data may include interactions with living individuals (e.g., private messages), raising privacy concerns for those still alive. What if the dead wants to be private what the living wants to be public, and vice versa? A thanatosensitive DAI service must have ethically justifiable answers to these questions.</p><p class="secondary-text">In some cases, these choices are made by local governments. Germany, for example, recently decided that digital accounts are inheritable, meaning that those the deceased is survived by have the right to access their post-mortem data. The decision resulted from a case in which parents requested access to the Facebook account of their 15-year-old daughter who had recently died. Facebook was obligated to comply with the decision despite the fact that it contradicted their policy at the time.</p><p class="secondary-text">For the last point, we can simply swap “AI” with DAI tech. This point is especially important because it emphasizes communication, not just internally, but with other firms as well. Only communication can prevent a race to the bottom that would end up harming people and the DAI firms that serve them.</p><img class="secondary-img lightbox-trigger" src="images/oversight01-bw.webp" alt="oversight01"><p class="secondary-text">The Logo for Meta’s oversight board, an independent legal entity established in an attempt to augment Meta’s capacity to self-regulate and contend with issues concerning privacy and consent.

Sentience involves the processing of external stimuli and the internal states that arise from them, including thoughts, desires, and emotional responses. Unlike mere reflexive behavior, sentience implies a level of consciousness where an organism or entity can experience its environment and its own mental and emotional states.</p><p class="secondary-text">Sentience is a key consideration in ethics because it is often seen as the basis for moral consideration. Entities that are capable of experiencing pain, pleasure, or other emotions are typically regarded as deserving of ethical treatment.</p><p class="secondary-text">The same issues could be raised for sentient AI, especially models based on real people. While current AI lacks sentience—it does not feel pain or experience emotions—there is growing concern over the development of increasingly advanced artificial systems.

He argues that humanity\'s capacity to forget has historically played a critical role in individual and societal well-being. Forgetting allows people to move on from the past, focus on the present, and avoid being trapped by earlier decisions or mistakes. Digital technology has disrupted this natural process by creating a world where information is preserved indefinitely. Mayer-Schönberger examines the consequences of this shift, including the erosion of personal privacy, the potential for misjudgments based on outdated information, and the inability to escape one’s digital past.</p><p class="secondary-text">To address these issues, Mayer-Schönberger advocates for the integration of "digital forgetting" mechanisms into technological systems.

These solutions aim to restore balance between memory and forgetting, thereby protecting individuals and fostering a healthier relationship with digital information.</p><p class="secondary-text">The archival equivalent of “forgetting” is omission.

These storage mediums come in various forms, each with its characteristics in terms of capacity, speed, durability, and use cases. Here are some examples with specifications as to how long they can store data at optimal conditions without risk of corruption:</p><ul class="secondary-list"><li><p class="secondary-text">Hard Disk Drives (HDDs): HDDs use spinning magnetic disks to store data. They offer large storage capacities at relatively low cost but are slower and more prone to mechanical failure due to their moving parts. Because of this, they typically last 3-6 years.</p></li><li><p class="secondary-text">2D Optical Storage: These include CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs, which store data using laser technology. Data on these mediums varies depending on the type of disc. Commercial-grade CDs typically last 10-20 years while the archival-grade m-disc can last for up to 1000 years.</p></li><li><p class="secondary-text">Flash Memory: These include compact and portable devices like USB keys, memory cards, and SSDs (solid-state drives). Flash memory cells in these drives can degrade over time, especially with frequent read/write operations. The amount of time these devices can store data depends on the frequency of use, but they typically last 5-15 years.</p></li><li><p class="secondary-text">Magnetic Tape: Used primarily for large-scale archival storage, magnetic tape offers high capacity and longevity at a low cost. However, it is slower in data retrieval compared to other mediums. They can preserve data for 30 years or more under optimal storage conditions.</p></li><li><p class="secondary-text">3D Optical Storage: This is a relatively new form of storage in which data is encoded into a 3D block of material via lasers. This material, typically a kind of crystalline silicon, is extremely resistant to heat and other forms of environmental degradation and can last for billions of years. The problem is that the technology to create and read this type of storage is not widely distributed.</p></li></ul><p class="secondary-text">A DAI firm will have to decide what form of storage best suits the needs of their customers. This, of course, depends on the kind of service the firm in question is proposing, as each will have to strike a different balance between accessibility and durability.

Unlike traditional storage methods where files are kept on local devices like hard drives, cloud storage allows data to be uploaded to the cloud, enabling users and their designated heirs to retrieve digital legacies from anywhere in the world. Cloud storage providers typically operate on a pay-as-you-go model, allowing DAI firms to scale storage capacity based on their needs without worrying about maintaining physical hardware. Its scalability ensures that as the volume of user data grows, storage capacity can be expanded seamlessly. Popular cloud storage services include Google Drive, Dropbox, and Amazon S3.</p><p class="secondary-text">However, reliance on cloud storage also comes with notable challenges. Data privacy is a critical concern, as firms must ensure compliance with stringent regulations like GDPR while safeguarding sensitive user information from breaches. Furthermore, the long-term sustainability of cloud storage depends on the financial and operational stability of the cloud provider, raising concerns about data availability if the provider ceases operations. There are also potential risks of vendor lock-in, where migrating vast datasets to another provider or on-premises system becomes costly and complex.

The lack of governmental policy surrounding digital legacy has made its administration difficult for several reasons. First, the historical absence of clear laws and regulations means that there is no standardized framework to address issues such as data ownership, privacy, or access after a person’s death. As a result, families, executors, and service providers face legal ambiguity when attempting to manage digital assets. Without guidance, companies often defer to their own terms of service, which are rarely designed with death in mind and can vary widely across platforms. Here are a few concrete examples of how governmental policy is inadequate.</p><ul class="secondary-list"><li><p class="secondary-text">Regulations exist, such as 16 CFR § 453 in the US Federal Regulation Code (a.k.a the Funeral Rule), that prevent predatory funeral practices that take advantage of people in their time of grief, but these regulations don’t apply to DAI services that target the same clientele.</p></li><li><p class="secondary-text">The Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act (RUFADAA) allows fiduciaries (like estate executors or trustees) to manage the digital assets of deceased people, provided they have explicit authorization. However, RUFADAA defaults to platforms’ user agreements when a deceased person hasn’t named power of attorney but doesn’t mandate platforms to create clear pathways for digital legacy, instead placing the burden on users to provide consent while alive.</p></li><li><p class="secondary-text">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) criminalizes unauthorized access to computers and digital data. This law can make it illegal for anyone, including family members or fiduciaries, to access a deceased person’s online accounts without authorization. Without explicit pre-death consent, families risk violating this act by trying to access a loved one’s digital accounts, even for estate management purposes.</p></li></ul><img class="secondary-img lightbox-trigger" src="images/gpl01-bw.webp" alt="gpl01"> <p class="secondary-text">An example of a General Price List (GPL) provided by a funeral home.

The theory suggests that a fundamental psychological conflict arises from our instinct for self-preservation coupled with the awareness that death is inevitable and often unpredictable. This conflict generates terror, which is managed through a mix of escapism and cultural beliefs that counter the reality of mortality by offering more enduring forms of meaning and value. Essentially, these beliefs help counteract the sense of personal insignificance associated with death by providing significance through symbolism. TMT also posits that other cultural values, such as religion, national identity, and legacy, offer a form of symbolic immortality that can assuage our collective terror.</p><p class="secondary-text"><i>Although we typically take our cultural worldview for granted, it is actually a fragile human construction that people spend great energy creating, maintaining, and defending.

The deceased’s data may include interactions with living individuals (e.g., private messages), raising privacy concerns for those still alive. What if the dead wants to be private what the living wants to be public, and vice versa? A thanatosensitive DAI service must have ethically justifiable answers to these questions.</p><p class="secondary-text">In some cases, these choices are made by local governments. Germany, for example, recently decided that digital accounts are inheritable, meaning that those the deceased is survived by have the right to access their post-mortem data.
