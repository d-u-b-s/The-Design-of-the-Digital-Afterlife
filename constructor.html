<h2 class="secondary-title">Conflicts</h2>
<p class="secondary-text">Cumulatively, millions have died in European wars of succession, where the inheritance of a royal title and the power that comes with it is contested by a rival faction. The sheer amount of blood that has been spilled in the pursuit of hereditary immortality speaks to its power to inspire. Here’s an inexhaustive list of such conflicts, restricted to Europe:</p>
<ul class="secondary-list">
    <li><p class="secondary-text">The War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714) - 105,000 dead: Death of the childless Charles II of Spain.</p></li>

<h2 class="secondary-title">Declining religiosity</h2>
<p class="secondary-text">In the US, Millennials are about 4 times more likely to declare themselves unaffiliated with any religion than their grandparents. Stats like these indicate a generational shift away from organized religions and the various afterlives they propose.</p>

<h2 class="secondary-title">Digitization</h2>
<p class="secondary-text">Digitization is the process of converting physical information, such as documents, images, or objects, into digital formats. This typically involves scanning or photographing physical items and then using software to create digital files, such as PDFs, images, or data entries. These digital files can then be stored, accessed, and shared electronically, making the information more accessible, searchable, and preservable. Digitization plays a key role in preserving cultural heritage, improving access to information, and supporting the transition to digital archives and records.</p>
<p class="secondary-text">History shows that despite these efforts, technology has progressed and will continue to do so.</p>

In the context of digital immortality, preserving data is important because it’s the material that enables us to transmit information to future generations. Its loss represents a loss of information that these future generations can access.

  Behavior is influenced
</h2>
<p class="secondary-text">
  Research by Mori et al. compares the ways in which users reacted to the murder of American teenager Anna Svidersky on three different platforms: MySpace, Youtube, and an online condolence book. They concluded that the functionalities and design of each platform affected the character of the public grieving that occurred. Notably, they noticed there was significantly more trolling on Youtube as opposed to virtual spaces expressly designed for grieving, probably due to the fact that Youtube is much more anonymous.
